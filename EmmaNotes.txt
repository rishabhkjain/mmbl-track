# Notes on setting up Rishabh's code on Emma's machine.
# Machine: Linux Ubuntu 20.04
# Date: 06-10-2021
# Rishabh's code is Python 2 based on commands in README.md

1. install pip2.7 so that I can install python packages

$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py
$ sudo python2.7 get-pip.py
$ which pip2.7 

2. create a virtual environment inside the repo and activate

$ python -m virtualenv ./env
$ source env/bin/activate

3. updated createFolders.py to use Path commands instead of OS commands

4. Useful commentary on how to include requirements in a git repo without
uploading the entire virtual environment: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6590688/is-it-bad-to-have-my-virtualenv-directory-inside-my-git-repository

5. To install the right version of opencv (cv2): 

$ pip2 install opencv-python==4.2.0.32
